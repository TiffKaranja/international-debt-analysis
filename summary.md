# Summary of Key Findings

Here are some key takeaways from the analysis of international debt data:

- **Highest Debt**: The country with the highest total debt (based on the dataset) was China.

- **Most Common Indicator**: The most common debt indicator was "PPG, other private creditors (DIS, current US$)".

- **Average Debt by Indicator**: Calculated average debt per indicator helped compare financial patterns across countries.

- **Principal vs Interest**: Countries with high disbursements often showed lower repayments (both interest and principal), suggesting a reliance on long-term debt.

- **Repayment Trends**: Some countries make consistent principal repayments, while others mostly accrue interest.

These trends can help understand international financial behaviors, credit risk, and areas of vulnerability.
